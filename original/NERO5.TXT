Move your pieces with ARROW KEYS and ENTER.

You can INTERRUPT Nero's search by pressing SPACE.
                                                 
During play Nero writes down the played moves into file 'WEPLAYED.TXT'
so you can watch them later. (Or view with some PGN reading program.)

SETUP has HIDDEN FEATURE: Press '?' (or F5) in setup, and you get a RANDOM
position (sometimes illegal). Press '?' again to get a new random position 
etc... until you continue with 'W' or 'B' giving the side to move next.

MATE SOLVING (selected in setup) looks for shortest possible mate. (And 
shows you possible duals too.) Often a mate is found much quicker without 
mate solving, but ordinary search doesn't necessarily find the shortest 
mate. I recommend this mate solving feature for mate in 2..4 problems.
(Except Nero won't solve yet problems where under promotions are needed.)
